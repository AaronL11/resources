# Machine Learning

## Bias and Variance

**Bias** is a measure of how well the model fits the training dataset. **Variance** is a measure of how well the model fits a testing dataset, or even new data.

### Overfitting

When the model has low bias and high variance, this is called **overfitting**.

Overfitting essentially means that the model has been tuned to accurately represent the training dataset, but is not capable of making confident pedictions on new data.

This can happen if the training data is not very diverse, or if there isn't a lot of examples to work with.

## Correcting Models

There are a few ways we can correct for overfit models.

### Regulerization

### Boosting

## Approaches

There are various approaches to machine learning. This is a general overview of what each approach does, specific model implementations will be looked at later in the next chapter.

### Supervised Learning

### Unsupervised Learning

### Reinforcement Learning
