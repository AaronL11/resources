# Introduction

## What is Programming?

Programming is the act of creating instructions and algorithms for a computer to perform automatically. Essentially it is the act of telling a computer how and when to manipulate certain data.

## What will I cover?

I will be covering the following topics in as much detail necessary, I won't be spending much time per topic only a few minutes at most. This isn't meant to be a step-by-step guide, it's meant to make you familiar with a lot of the main components of programming and software design at the start. Later on I plan to make tutorials for each piece individually, going into more detail, but for now we will just have to settle for a quick overview.
