# Functions of Multiple Variables

We define a single variable function as a mapping $f$ from a domain $X$ to a codomain $Y$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
    f:X&\rightarrow Y\\
    x&\mapsto f(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    F:X_1\times X_2&\rightarrow Y\\
    (x_1,x_2)&\mapsto f(x_1,x_2)
\end{aligned}
$$
We can do this for more dimensions as well.

## Graphing Functions

We already have a good intuition for graphing single variable functions. What about multi variable functions. For this we will take a look at functions in 2 variables.

To graph a function, you simply put a point at $(x,y)$ with a height of $f(x,y)$. So for example, if our function is $f(x,y) = xy$, then at some point $x$ and some point $y$, the height of our function is $xy$:
